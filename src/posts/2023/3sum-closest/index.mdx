# 16. 3Sum Closest

[3Sum Closest - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

Using two-pointer method. 

Loop through sorted list and initialise a left and right point after the current iteration. 

For example: 

Given a list of *nums*

If *i = 0*, initialise *left = i +1* and *right = len(nums) - 1*

If sum of i, left and right is less than target, then increase left pointer by 1

If sum of i, left and right is greater than target, then decrease right pointer by 1

Loop through entire list and you will find the closest to target

If sum of i, left and right == target, then end the loop early and return sum

```python
# 16. 3Sum Closest

def threeSumClosest(nums, target):

    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    diff = float("inf")
    res = 0

    for i in range(len(sorted_nums)):

        # Initialize left and right pointer
        left = i + 1
        right = len(sorted_nums) - 1

        while left < right:
            total = sorted_nums[i] + sorted_nums[left] + sorted_nums[right]

            # Check if the difference is greater than previous results
            if abs(total - target) < diff:
                res = total
                diff = abs(total - target)

            # If total == target the end loop prematurely and return total
            if total == target:
                return total

            # If total is less than target then increment left pointer, if greater then decrement right pointer
            if total < target:
                left += 1
            elif total > target:
                right -= 1

    return res

print(threeSumClosest([-1, 2, 1, -4], 1))

# 835. Image Overlap

[Image Overlap - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-overlap/)

Find all the positions (tuple) of 1’s in both img1 and img2 and append to lists A and B respecitvely.

Loop through and compare all positions of A to positions in B. Find the translation of each position in A to position in B and store result in a hashmap. This will determine which positions in A and B have common translations when overlapped. 

**For example:**

Given `img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]`

The positions of the 1’s are given by A = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)], B = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

When comparing A[0] to B[0], the translation is (1, 1) 

We then store the tuple into a hashmap my_dict[(1, 1)] = 1

This tells us that when there is a transaltion fo (1, 1) there is going to be 1 overlap

We then continue and loop through all A and B and add to the count for each transaltion

```python
def largestOverlap(img1, img2):

# Position of all 1's in img1
    A = [
        (row, col)
        for row in range(len(img1))
        for col in range(len(img1))
        if img1[row][col] == 1
    ]

# Position of all 1's in img2
    B = [
        (row, col)
        for row in range(len(img2))
        for col in range(len(img2))
        if img2[row][col] == 1
    ]

    my_dict = {}

    for i in A:
        for j in B:
            # translation comparing i to j
            t = (j[0] - i[0], j[1] - i[1])

            # store translation in hashmap as a count, add to the count when the same translatipon is found
            if t in my_dict:
                my_dict[t] += 1
            else:
                my_dict[t] = 1

    # Check that my_dict is not emtpy. Need to account for the fact that there may be no overlaps at all
    if my_dict.values():
        return max(my_dict.values())
    else:
        return 0
```
